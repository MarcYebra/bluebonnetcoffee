          <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <h4>It All Started in The Heart Of Texas</h4>
            <p>Howdy! Bluebonnet Coffee was built on the idea of cultivating a tribe of individuals who identify themselves as 
              hardworking, brave, resilient, and friendly. Whichever road led you to us, it doesn’t matter. Our belief at Bluebonnet
              is that everyone be treated with the same level of respect and kindness. Our goal is for every customer to leave
              satisfied and inspired to face the world head on!

          <h2>Why Bluebonnet Coffee?</h2>
            <p>Being a Texan isn’t about throwing on cowboy boots and saying “yee-haw,” it’s a way of life. Just like bluebonnets, 
              Texans are vibrant, work best in heat, and hard to ignore because of how darn beautiful we are! <br></br>
              Coffee shops are more than places to sit and drink, they’re ways of expressing yourself. Bluebonnet Coffee hopes to 
              fill your cup with love, passion, and a little bit of fire to light up your day. We pride ourselves in our work ethic, so whether 
              you’re a student needing a place to study, an entrepreneur needing a place to meet with investors, or you’ve got family 
              visiting from Boston, Bluebonnet Coffee is here to serve your needs.
